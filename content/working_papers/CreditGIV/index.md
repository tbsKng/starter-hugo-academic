abstract: "This paper studies the micro origins of credit supply shocks and their implications for bank-level and aggregate credit dynamics. Using comprehensive euro area loan-level data from AnaCredit, we first examine how banks reallocate credit in response to idiosyncratic bank-level credit supply shocks, highlighting borrower heterogeneity and asymmetries between expansionary and contractionary shocks. We then use these idiosyncratic shocks to construct aggregate credit supply shocks based on the granular instrumental variable (GIV) approach. The resulting shocks isolate variation in credit supply that is orthogonal to common shocks while predicting aggregate credit fluctuations."
