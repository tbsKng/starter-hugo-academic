abstract: "We study the incidence and macroeconomic consequences of wholesale funding runs in 143 countries from 1800 to 2024. We construct a new narrative chronology on wholesale runs from 578 sources and use historical data on banks' liability structure to measure run severity.  Wholesale runs have happened with unprecedented frequency over the last 20 years, are more frequent than retail runs, and are concentrated in countries where deposit insurance shields retail depositors. As a result, bank runs either by wholesale or retail creditors now have happen with unprecedented frequency.  Wholesale funding runs are associated with larger output gaps than retail runs, especially when explained by foreign withdrawals (``sudden stops''). At least in part, this is because retail depositors are more likely to run for reasons unrelated to financial and macroeconomic fundamentals. Greater reliance on wholesale funding is linked to deeper output contractions after runs and banking crises, but not after recessions outside of crisis periods. Overall, our findings point to a structural shift in financial stability risks: wholesale funding markets have diversified banks' funding sources but also increased the likelihood of severe, non-linear shocks to the real economy."
