  abstract={I examine how financial constraints shape the transmission of aggregate external equity financing shocks to firms' equity issuance, outstanding debt, and investment. I construct a novel instrument for aggregate equity financing shocks from firm-level data using the Granular Instrumental Variable (GIV) strategy. 
 I find that financially unconstrained firms--characterized by high cash holdings and dividend-paying status--increase equity issuance by 1.8–2.0 percentage points, substitute equity for debt, and boost investment when capital market conditions improve. Highly leveraged firms, in contrast, refuse both to issue new equity and to reduce outstanding debt, consistent with the leverage ratchet effect. The debt overhang of highly leveraged firms results in 1.9 percentage points lower investment rates compared to the average firm. These results emphasize the crucial role of financial constraints in external equity financing and highlight the broader macroeconomic implications of debt overhang.}
