abstract: "I examines how financial constraints shape the transmission of aggregate external equity financing shocks to firms' equity issuance, changes in outstanding debt, and investment. I construct an instrument for aggregate equity financing shocks from firm-level data using the Granular Instrumental Variable (GIV) method. The empirical analysis reveals marked heterogeneity in firmsâ€™ responses: financially unconstrained firms, as proxied by high cash holdings and dividend-paying status, increase equity issuance significantly by about 1.2 percentage points, substitute equity for debt, and significantly increase investment when capital market conditions improve. Highly leveraged firms in contrast refuse both to issue new equity and to reduce outstanding debt consistent with the leverage ratchet effect. In line with existing evidence on the adverse effects of debt overhang, highly leveraged firms invest 2 percentage points less compared to the average firm in the sample. These findings underscore the importance of considering firm heterogeneity in capital market frictions."
